# About Fynn
Fynn was made for me to learn [discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py): it *is* my first bot, ever! I'm still learning dpy (and developing Fynn), but it already has a lot of functionality that aids with server moderation big time!

# Commands
Fynn operates through slash commands, and you can bring up all his commands by typing `/` and then clicking on Fynn's [profile picture](https://github.com/its-truce/fynn/blob/main/main/pfp.png).

* `/members`: Sends total number of members, bots, and humans.
* `/user_info`: Displays info about a member.
* `/reporting`: Set up message reporting.
* `/report`: Report a message. Only works if reporting has been setup for the guild.
* `/edit_log`: Set up message edit logging.
* `/deletion_log`: Set up message deletion logging.
* `/reaction_log`: Set up reaction logging.
* `/redirect`: Redirect messages from one channel to another

# To Do
